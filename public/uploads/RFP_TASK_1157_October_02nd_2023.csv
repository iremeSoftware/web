,"Hi Arul,We have analyzed the scope shared by the client. Client wants to do enhancements on top of an existing website(www.titleloop.com). The are 4 user groups in the system(Admin, Signing Services, Lenders and Title Companies). The requirement is to add a page which allows the Signing services(Clients/Customers) user group to advertise their services where the other user groups except admin can view it. There are 4 accounts(Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum) which can be subscribed by the&nbsp;Clients/Customers and based on the account type they can advertise their products in the website. Admin can manage (enable and disable) features for the 4 different types of memberships from the backend Interface.Since its an enhancement task. Kindly execute a T&amp;M contract to take up this Project.Note: If client is looking for a ballpark number, Kindly get us the code base access.Regards,Amar"

,"Hi Suresh/Vinay,&nbsp;Here you go.&nbsp;"
,"Below are the findings and queries from our end:
1. We have cloned the source code of https://www.titleloop.com from bitbucket, we have identified that the website is built upon PHP 8.x and utilizes the cakePHP framework. The codebase reveals a lot of customizations made.
2. The database file is not available. If we receive the database file, we will import it locally, facilitating an examination of the application. Could you provide access to the database file to setup this project locally?
3. Analyzing the code, we have observed route files corresponding to each user category encompassing functionalities like listing, addition, editing, updating, and deletion. Additionally, we noticed the presence of 2 registration options: Title Registration and Notary Public. Could you kindly provide us with the login credentials for these 2 user roles?
4. API routes have been established for admin, lender, signing, and title users. We would like to clarify whether there's a need for additional API development to fulfill new requirements. Furthermore, could you confirm whether these APIs are utilized by applications or external sites?
5. Concerning payments for user groups, should we integrate Stripe subscriptions for recurring payments, or is the preference for one-time payments per subscription plan? We noticed that Stripe is already integrated into the donation page."

,"Hi Amar, please find the answers below---------------------------------------------------------------1. We have cloned the source code of https://www.titleloop.com from bitbucket, we have identified that the website is built upon PHP 8.x and utilizes the cake PHP framework. A lot of customizations were made. This is a true statment 2. API routes have been established for admin, lender, signing, and title users. We would like to clarify whether there's a need for additional API development to fulfill new requirements. There is really no need for additional API work, we have 2 separate parts of the site, the actual API and the website for customers and clients...which is what you will be working on. Furthermore, could you confirm whether these APIs are utilized by applications or external sites? The API's are utilized by external sites for the most part. 3. Concerning payments for user groups, should we integrate Stripe subscriptions for recurring payments, or is the preference for one-time payments per subscription plan? Subscription Plan We noticed that Stripe is already integrated into the donation page. Yes, I believe we should build out and enhance the integration with Stripe. 4. As mentioned, the database file is not available. If we get the DB file, we can import it locally, and examine the existing system.&nbsp;Attached here is the sql to create the database. I can provide you with data if that is necessary."
,"Hi Vinay,Please find below the client response for our queries, Also please find the attached SQL Tables schema in previous mail thread.. Kindly analyze and provide your inputs.1. We have cloned the source code of https://www.titleloop.com from bitbucket, we have identified that the website is built upon PHP 8.x and utilizes the cake PHP framework. A lot of customizations were made.
Res: This is a true statement
2. API routes have been established for admin, lender, signing, and title users. We would like to clarify whether there's a need for additional API development to fulfill new requirements.
Res: There is really no need for additional API work, we have 2 separate parts of the site, the actual API and the website for customers and clients...which is what you will be working on.
Furthermore, could you confirm whether these APIs are utilized by applications or external sites?
The API's are utilized by external sites for the most part.
3. Concerning payments for user groups, should we integrate Stripe subscriptions for recurring payments, or is the preference for one-time payments per subscription plan?
Subscription Plan
We noticed that Stripe is already integrated into the donation page.
Yes, I believe we should build out and enhance the integration with Stripe.
4. As mentioned, the database file is not available. If we get the DB file, we can import it locally, and examine the existing system.
Res: Attached here is the sql to create the database. I can provide you with data if that is necessary.Regards,Amar"
,"Hi Amar
Thanks for the details.
Below is our update from our end:
1. We encountered some errors when attempting to import the database schema file locally, such as the issue with field and index sizes, like the error message """"#1709 - Index column size too large. The maximum column size is 767 bytes."""" To resolve these issues, we manually adjusted the database schema and successfully imported the database.
2. Upon connecting to the database and running the application, we encountered additional errors related to undefined constants. For example:
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Undefined constant """"API_ADMIN_LENDER_ROUTES"""" in C:\wamp64\www\projects\phpprojects\titleloop-api-gateway\config\api.routes.php
These constants, including API_ADMIN_LENDER_ROUTES, API_ADMIN_SIGNING_ROUTES, and API_ADMIN_TITLE_ROUTES, were not defined in the codebase. Please refer to the attached screenshot.
3. We couldn't locate the .env file or a copy of the env.example file within the codebase.
4. To facilitate this, it would be highly beneficial if you could provide us with both the .env file and the database file containing some sample data. Alternatively, granting access to a testing site with user group credentials would allow us to thoroughly explore the frontend and backend features."
,"Hi Arul,Our technical team imported the database. The .env file is missing and also we do not have the sample data for database, hence we are unable to set up the application locally.&nbsp; Since its an enhancement work and our team analyzed the code base, rather than having to and fro communication with the client, we can provide ballpark estimates, execute T&amp;M contract and work on this project.The ballpark estimates to implement the tasks mentioned in the scope document(TitleLoop-Connect_Description) would be 100 hours.Having requested kindly execute T&amp;M contract.Regards,Amar"
